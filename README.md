Project Name: Meetup

Description: "Meetup" is a comprehensive front-end web project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as the final project for completing a course on web development. The site follows a modern and clean design based on the Figma prototype and showcases a high level of functionality and adaptability. As a front-end developer, I ensured the project is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across all screen sizesâ€”whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

Key Features:

HTML Structure: The website is built with clean, semantic HTML, ensuring that the content is well-organized, accessible, and search engine optimized.
CSS Styling: The design was brought to life with custom CSS, using modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid to create a dynamic and fluid layout. Media queries ensure that the design scales effectively for different screen resolutions.
JavaScript Functionality: Interactive elements and dynamic content on the site were implemented using vanilla JavaScript. These include interactive buttons, form validation, and smooth transitions.
Responsive Design: The website adapts seamlessly to any device, providing a smooth and consistent user experience whether accessed from a phone, tablet, or desktop.
Performance: The project is optimized for fast loading speeds and smooth performance, ensuring users have a high-quality experience.
Figma Design: The original design for this project can be viewed here.
